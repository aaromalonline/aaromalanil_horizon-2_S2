# DC Motor Controller

Tinkercad Simulation (On work) : https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7ilSyFXO52m-dcmotor-controller

- Arduino to control a DC motor with an encoder. The motor should accept relative angle inputs from the Serial Monitor and move by the specified angle from its current position, remaining within the range of -180° to +180°. Extend your project to control two DC motors with encoders and handle their simultaneous operation.
- Connect a 16x2 LCD with a brightness control potentiometer. Display real-time angles for both motors and show error messages for any angle limit violations.
